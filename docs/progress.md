# Progress

Where the build actually is. [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) says what each phase is *for*; this says
what is **done, verified, and outstanding**. Update it when a phase closes or a decision is made.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-12 · **Phase 1 complete** · next up: phase 2 (indexers)

## Phases

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Foundation — skeleton, SQLite, TMDB, library scanner | **done** — verified 2026-08-12 |
| **2** | Indexers — YTS, TPB, then 1337x through minter | **next** — 1337x code already absorbed, unwired |
| 3 | Downloads — qBittorrent client, magnet dispatch, state polling | unblocked (was NordVPN `AUTH_FAILED`) |
| 4 | Import — completion watcher, hardlink, rename, Jellyfin refresh | |
| 5 | Interface — Next.js screens embedded via `embed.FS` | |
| 6 | Cutover — run alongside, confirm parity, remove seven containers | back up the *arr configs first |

## Phase 1 tasks

Each commit builds, vets, tests and cross-compiles on its own, so a bisect lands on one task.

| Task | Package | Commit | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| [T1](tasks/T1-scaffold.md) scaffold | `cmd/curator/`, `internal/config/` | `b209627` | 4 |
| [T2](tasks/T2-store.md) store | `internal/store/` | `849b28c` | 15 |
| [T3](tasks/T3-library-scanner.md) scanner | `internal/library/` | `9bb462d` | 15 |
| [T4](tasks/T4-tmdb-client.md) TMDB | `internal/tmdb/` | `ede2413` | 14 |
| [T6](tasks/T6-absorb-cfprobe.md) absorb cfprobe | `internal/indexer/` | `d2057bb` | 20 |
| [T5](tasks/T5-api.md) API | `internal/api/` | `d7c9111` | 12 |
| [T7](tasks/T7-test-fixture.md) fixture | `testdata/library/` | `44be67e` | — |

`internal/indexer` is **absorbed but unwired** — nothing imports it. That is phase 2's job.

## What was verified, and how

Run 2026-08-12 against the real TMDB API and the live fixture.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/scan` (cold) | `{"scanned":29,"added":29,"matched":29,"unmatched":0}` in 9.0 s |
| `POST /api/scan` (rescan) | `{"scanned":29,"added":0,"matched":0,"unmatched":0}` in 0.016 s |
| `GET /api/movies` | 29, with 29 distinct `library_path` values |
| `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build ./...` | passes |
| Pi library | `ssh pi 'ls /media/storage/media/movies \| wc -l'` → 29 |

The 0.016 s rescan is the evidence that a second scan makes **no TMDB calls**: nothing is left with
a NULL `tmdb_id`.

**The matches were checked for correctness, not just presence.** Storing the folder title means a
wrong match would be invisible from our own API, so all seven 2026 ids were queried back against
TMDB — every one is the right film with a 2026 release date. `Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan - Ghost War`
→ `1380291`, whose canonical title is `Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan: Ghost War`: a colon exactly where the
folder has ` - `, matched on the raw string with the fallback never firing. That is
[D9](decisions.md#d9--query-tmdb-with-the-raw-folder-title) confirmed on live data.

Also verified end to end: the no-key path scans 29 and reports 29 unmatched; `GET /api/movies/{id}`
returns 404 with `{"error": "..."}`; a non-numeric id returns 400; `SIGTERM` shuts down gracefully.

### Re-verify from scratch

```bash
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./...
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build ./...

rm -f curator.db* && set -a && . ./.env && set +a && go run ./cmd/curator &
curl -s -X POST localhost:8090/api/scan | jq                      # 29/29/29/0
curl -s localhost:8090/api/movies | jq 'length'                   # 29
curl -s localhost:8090/api/movies | jq '[.[]|select(.tmdb_id==null)|.title]'   # []
curl -s -X POST localhost:8090/api/scan | jq '.added'             # 0
```

`go test -short` skips the one live TMDB test, which also skips when no key is present.

## Open threads

Neither blocking, both decided rather than forgotten.

- **`cfprobe` is not deleted**, though [T6](tasks/T6-absorb-cfprobe.md) step 6 says to. That repo has
  **no git remote** — all three commits are local-only, so the directory is the only copy — and T6
  deliberately does not port `cmd/fp` or the uTLS transport. Deleting it would destroy the tooling
  that produced [D2](decisions.md#d2--fetch-pages-through-the-browser-do-not-reuse-cookies)'s JA3 /
  JA4 / HTTP-2 measurements. The numbers survive here; the ability to re-run them would not. Push it
  somewhere before deleting.
- **`/opt/docker/backups/` on the Pi is still empty.** Backing up
  `/opt/docker/configs/{radarr,sonarr,prowlarr}` — roughly 230 MB, currently on an SD card with no
  copy anywhere — is the rollback path for phase 6. Deferred because it writes to the Pi, and the
  *arr stack is meant to be untouched until cutover.

## Carried into phase 2

- **`Release` has nowhere to put the 1337x detail-page href.** Lazy magnet resolution needs one, so
  it is an unexported `detailPath`; a `Release` that round-trips through JSON or SQLite loses its
  resolvability. Either the API layer holds it in memory between search and pick, or the field gets
  promoted to exported. Undecided on purpose.
- **`MINTER_URL`'s documented default is a trap on this machine.** minter binds IPv4 only, so
  `http://localhost:8191` resolves to `::1` first and fails while `http://127.0.0.1:8191` works.
- **The absorbed indexer is unwired**, so phase 2 starts from a tested `parseSearch`, `parseQuality`,
  `InfoHash` and minter client rather than a blank file.

## Corrections made to the docs

Recorded so the reasoning is not lost.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Six → **seven** 2026 releases in the fixture | `CLAUDE.md`, `decisions.md` D9, `T4`, `T7` |
| Phases 3–4 no longer blocked — `gluetun` and `qbittorrent` are healthy | `CLAUDE.md`, `roadmap.md` |
| `.gitignore`'s unanchored `curator` also matched the `cmd/curator/` **directory**, silently excluding the command from git | `.gitignore` |
